12/8/2023 10:15:55,#N/A,10th,,Mexicano/a,Mx Brassey makes me feel the most safe. Her words and actions are all kind and in the best interest of the students. She is understanding and very helpful. She does anything in her power to make sure everyone gets the learning that they deserve. I have seen her multiple times encourage students who aren’t paying attention to do their work. She doesn’t turn her back on any student that I have seen. She is amazing at what she does. Her classroom is a safe space not only for me but I know for many more people. ,Brassey,Mr Hancock and Mx Brassey are two adults that make the most sense when they discuss any of the above. Mostly because they actually provide examples and are very knowledgeable of what they do say. They will listen to you first and then either agree or improve your perspective on a discussion. They are very impactful because they are actually teaching with these discussions not only about the topic but also how to actively be in a discussion where no one interrupts but gets their point across. ,One adult that I think should be learnt from is Mx Brassey. They have always made sure her classroom is a safe space to anyone. Other adults should learn to be a bit more considerate and patient with other students who might not be having the best day. I see sometimes that teachers fail to try and communicate with students. Mx Brassey always tries to be understanding and at the same time do her job which is teaching I think she does an excellent job at teaching and supporting students who are not having the best of days to actually actively learn.,Assembly’s are always fun to watch or be in. Specially when there’s ballet folklore involved. ,Be understanding of students days and how it affects them on the daily on trying to learn. A lot of these students do not have a safe space to be in or do not have a space where they actually want to actively learn. You need to actually do something for these students to want to actively learn. Only telling them won’t do anything. You guys need an actual strategy or a way for them to feel like they want to do the work because no one besides themselves can they decide to learn and if you guys just tell them to do their work it won’t do anything.,Have a talk with your secretary’s. They can be nice and all but they don’t feel like people who you can go to in the morning and give them your excuse for not being there. They are mean and will give you a bad look. I hate going to the office to ask them anything because of how they can act towards students. I actively avoid going just because of that reason. Please just tell them to not roll their eyes at students when they are going to the office for their help. This hasn’t happened only once but multiple times. Not only to me but to my friends.
